## Installation

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/credit-card-fraud-detection.git
   ```

2. Install the required Python packages as specified at the beginning of the code.

## Data Loading and Exploration

- The code loads the credit card transaction data from a CSV file.
- Initial data exploration is conducted to understand the dataset's structure.

## Data Preprocessing

- Data preprocessing steps are performed, including handling missing values and splitting the data into training, validation, and test sets.

## Model Development

- A base model (Random Forest Classifier) is created to build the fraud detection model.
- Class weighting is applied to handle the class imbalance, giving higher weight to the minority class (fraudulent transactions).

## Model Evaluation

- The model is evaluated using a classification report, which includes metrics such as precision, recall, F1-score, and support.

## Dataset Source

- The code assumes that the credit card transaction dataset is available in a CSV file. The source of this dataset should be specified in the code where the data is loaded.
